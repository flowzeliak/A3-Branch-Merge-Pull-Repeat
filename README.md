 It was the first day of wizard school and Harry Potter needed a drink. 
 Being the new kid at school, he had no friends to show him around. After wandering around the streets for hours,
 he stumble upon a potion shop. 
 
 Harry stumbled onto a red-headed kid on his way to the potion shop. 
 
 "Hello!" said the boy, "My name is Ron Weasley!"
 
 "Ron," said Harry, "This will be the first and last time I ever talk to you, certainly."
 
 Ron was shocked at Harry's rudeness. 
 
 "I'm just kidding!" said Harry, "I think we should always be friends!"
 
 "You totally got me bro," Ron replied, laughing, "What am I a Muggle over here?"
