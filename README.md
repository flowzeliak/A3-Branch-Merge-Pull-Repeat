 It was the first day of wizard school and Harry Potter needed a drink. 
 Being the new kid at school, he had no friends to show him around. After wandering around the streets for hours,
 he stumble upon a potion shop. 
 
 Harry stumbled onto a red-headed kid on his way to the potion shop. 
 
 "Hello!" said the boy, "My name is Ron Weasley!"
 
 "Ron," said Harry, "This will be the first and last time I ever talk to you, certainly."
 
 Ron was shocked at Harry's rudeness. 
 
 "I'm just kidding!" said Harry, "I think we should always be friends!"
 
 "You totally got me bro," Ron replied, laughing, "What am I a Muggle over here?"
 
 Harry laughed and took Ron by the hands and they proceeded to the potion shop.
 
 As they entered the potion shop, they saw a beautiful brunette near the Vodka section.
 
 Taken back by her beauty, Ron scurried over to talk to her.
 
 "Excuse me, I was wondering if you had an extra heart. Mine was just stolen." said Ron. 
 
 "I actually do but I don't think you would be able to afford it." said the girl. 
 
 That's when Harry swoop in with his flashy smile. 
 
 "Forgive my friend Ron. He's bad with women. I'm Harry. Can I get your name?"
 
 "Hermione." 
 
 "Check my fireball spell though," said Ron, who was clearly jealous.
 
 He shot a giant fireball across the street, it hit a Cadillac and the vehicle exploded into metal shrapnel and oily flames. 
 
 "You are a wild man Ron, holy smokes," said Hermione, who was clearly impressed.
